## Releases and container images

Every push to `main` is analysed by [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/).
The commit prefix decides the version bump — nobody types a version number:

| Commit | Result |
|---|---|
| `feat(scope): …` | minor bump |
| `fix(scope): …` | patch bump |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer | major bump |
| `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build` | patch bump, or no release at all |

A release publishes a tag, a GitHub Release and the changelog. The same workflow
then builds and pushes one container image per service to GHCR at exactly that
version, so an image tag always matches a git tag:

This repo publishes 1 image(s):

| Package | Image |
|---|---|
| `scraper` | `ghcr.io/asepharyana/scraper:scraper:<version>` |


Pull one without touching the registry UI:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/asepharyana/<repo>:<service>:<version>
```

### Adding or removing an image

Do not edit `.github/workflows/release.yml` to change which images are built.
The list lives in `.github/docker-images.json`:

```json
{ "images": [
  { "package": "<service>", "context": ".", "file": "Dockerfile" }
] }
```

- `package` becomes the GHCR path component, so it must be lowercase
  `[a-z0-9._-]`. It does not have to match the repo name.
- `context` is the build context directory, `file` the Dockerfile within it.
- `build_args` is an object of `KEY=value` pairs; the pipeline flattens it before
  the matrix, so both the object and a pre-joined `"A=1\nB=2"` string work.
- `"enabled": false` keeps an entry documented but skips building it. **An empty
  or fully disabled list fails the run** rather than publishing nothing.

Every enabled entry must have a `Dockerfile` **and** a `.dockerignore` in its
context, and both must be tracked by git — CI cannot see an untracked file, and a
missing `.dockerignore` silently ships `node_modules/` and `.git` inside the image.

`latest` tracks the newest stable release. Prereleases (`1.2.0-rc.1`) are
tagged but never promote `latest`.

### If a release fails

Check the run, then fix forward with a normal commit — do not re-tag by hand:

```bash
gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 5
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

A run that only built images and published no tag is normal for a `chore` push:
there was nothing to release, so no version was derived and no image was tagged.
